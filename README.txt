InteractiveRegistration is an open-source, cross-platform C++ toolkit for
interactive registration. It uses an enhanced PolyAffine transformation
model during registration. The local affine transforms for control points
are given by users interactively.

The toolkit may be built from source using CMake (http://www.cmake.org).
